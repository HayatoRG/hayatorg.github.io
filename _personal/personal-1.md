The Unofficial "About Me"
------

I wish I could say I knew what I was doing exactly.

Most of what’s listed on the homepage and CV was stitched together through guesswork, accidental luck, and a strange ability to have someone else willingly lead me out of the mess and clean up after me (and I sincerely appreciate it—and apologize for that).
I've started more projects than I've finished, misunderstood more methods than I've mastered, and bluffed my way through more fields than I'd like to admit. I don't know if that’s how people usually make a career.
But it’s how I ended up here.
And honestly, I'm still suspicious about how far that’s gotten me.

Outside of academia...

Outside of research, I spend a considerable amount of time being not particularly good at a variety of things I enjoy:

  -Photography (Aviation, Scenery, rarely people)
  
  -Drums and Guitar
  
  -Rhythm Games, both mobile and arcade
  
  -Game localization

Most of my interesta somehow trace back to rhythm and language, and I guess that's a sign :)
