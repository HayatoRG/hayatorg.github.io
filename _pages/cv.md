### CV of Failure:

This is something I promised to do after I received my last rejection in 2024. 

One can at most get half the story by only looking at the accomplishments listed in the CV. We're all experts at showcasing our achievements, the awards, grants, and shiny moments that are built upon missed deadlines, tons of rejection letters, and struggles that almost killed us.

So here's the other half of my CV: my CV of Failure. You are more than welcomed to scroll through the setbacks and screw-ups, as if we're being honest, that's where the real story is. And it is the only way to get a complete, unfiltered look at my path.
