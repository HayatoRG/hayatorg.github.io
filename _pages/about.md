Hi! You've landed on Jiurui's academic page and welcome!

I am an incoming DPhil student in Linguistics, Philology and Phonetics at the University of Oxford, geneoursly funded by the Clarendon Scholarship.
I am supervised by Prof. Elenor Payne and Dr. Anna Wilson. My research explores the alignment between prosody and gesture in spontaneous communication: the hidden choreography between movement and speech, the subtle ways it shapes (or fails to shape) meaning, and how such synchrony is developed during the acquisition of L2.
Broadly, I am interested in the phonetics-phonology interface, multimodal interaction, language documentation, language death and revitalization, and Aviation English.

Prior to joining Oxford LPP, I spent a year at National University of Singapore to complete a MSc in Statistics, and four years at the University of Virginia, where I received my undergraduate training in linguistics and applied statistics.
