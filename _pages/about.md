Hi! You've landed on Jiurui's academic page and welcome!

My name is Jiurui Guo (郭久睿, / kwo⁵⁵ t͡ɕjou̯²¹⁴ ʐwei̯⁵¹ /). I am an incoming DPhil student in Linguistics, Philology and Phonetics at the University of Oxford.
I am a Clarendon Scholar supervised by Prof. Elenor Payne and Dr. Anna Wilson. My research explores the alignment between prosody and gesture in spontaneous communication: the hidden choreography between movement and speech, the subtle ways it shapes (or fails to shape) meaning, and how such synchrony is developed during the acquisition of L2.

Prior to joining Oxford LPP, I spent a year at National University of Singapore to complete a MSc in Statistics, and four years at the University of Virginia, where I received my undergraduate training in linguistics and applied statistics.

And if you knew me in some past version:
Welcome, sorry, and thank you.
Part of me — and this page — is dedicated to you, too.
